# What's this? 

For my work I need to be able to style an entire website in different ways as easily as possible in Angular. Angular Material Themes seemed reasonable, but it wasn't especially easy to get the theme to apply to your own non-material components. So this app is just me showing how you would style a div with a material theme primary color. 


# Mat Test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
